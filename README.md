# mini-c-compiler
The Mini C Compiler is a simplified C-language interpreter designed to understand and execute basic C-like syntax using lex and yacc (Flex and Bison). It allows parsing and evaluation of expressions, control flow structures like if-else and supports basic I/O operations through printf and scanf.
